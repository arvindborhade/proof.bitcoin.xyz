<h1>{%trans%}What is proof of existence?{%endtrans%}</h1>

<p>
	{%trans%}Use our service to anonymously and securely store an online distributed
	proof of existence for any document.{%endtrans%}
	{%trans%}
	<strong>Your documents are NOT stored in our database or in the bitcoin blockchain</strong>, so you
	don't have to worry about your data being accessed by others.
	{%endtrans%}
</p>
<p>
    {%trans%}
	All we store is a <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function">cryptographic
		digest</a> of the file, linked to the time in which you submitted the
	document. In this way, you can later certify that the data existed at
	that time. This is the first online service allowing you to publicly
	prove that you have certain information without revealing the data or
	yourself, with a decentralized certification based on the <a
		href="http://bitcoin.org/">bitcoin network</a>.
	{%endtrans%}
</p>
<p>
    {%trans%}
	The key advantages are anonymity, privacy, and getting a decentralized
	proof which can't be erased or modified by anyone (third parties or governments). <strong>Your
		document's existence is permanently validated by the blockchain even
		if this site is compromised or down</strong>, so you don't depend or need to
	trust any central authority. All previous data timestamping solutions lack
	this freedom.

		{%trans%}
		You can prove certain data exists at a certain moment of time. As we
		use the <a href="https://blockchain.info/">bitcoin blockchain</a> to
		store the document proof, you can certify the existence of your
		document without the need of a central authority. Use the computing
		power of the whole bitcoin network to certify your data.

		{%trans%}If you store a proof for your document and later
		re-upload it, the system will only recognize it if it is completely
		and fully the same document. The slightest change, and we'll recognize
		it is different, giving you the security that certified data can't be
		changed.{%endtrans%}

<h3 id="technical" style="padding-top: 40px;">{%trans%}Technical foundations{%endtrans%}</h3>
<div class="row">
	<p>
	    {%trans%}
		The document is certified via embedding its <a
		href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2">SHA256</a> digest in the
		bitcoin blockchain. This is done by generating a special bitcoin
		transaction that encodes/contains the hash via an <a 
    href="">OP_RETURN script</a>. This is a <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script">
    bitcoin scripting opcode</a> that marks the transaction output as 
    <a href="https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/Script#Provably_Unspendable.2FPrunable_Outputs">
    provably unspendable</a> and allows a small amount of data to be inserted,
    which in our case is the document's hash, plus a marker to identify all
    of our transactions.
		{%endtrans%}
	</p>

	<p>
	    {%trans%}Once the transaction is
		confirmed, the document is permanently certified and proven to exist
		at least as early as the time the transaction was confirmed. 
    If the document hadn't existed at
		the time the transaction entered the blockchain, it would have been
		impossible to embed its digest in the
		transaction (This is because of the hash function's property of
		being <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function#Properties">
    second pre-image resistant</a>). Embedding some hash and then
		adapting a future document to match the hash is also impossible (due
		to the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function#Properties">
    pre-image resistance of hash functions</a>). This is why <strong>once the
		bitcoin blockchain confirms the transaction generated for the
		document, its existence is proven, permanently, with no trust required</strong>.{%endtrans%}</p>

	<p>{%trans%}If anyone wants to manually confirm the document's existence at
		the timestamped time, they should just follow these steps:{%endtrans%}
	<ul>
		<li>{%trans%}Calculate the document's SHA256 digest.{%endtrans%}</li>
		<li>{%trans%}Find a transaction in the bitcoin blockchain containing 
			an OP_RETURN output with the document's hash prepended by our marker bytes,
      which are 0x444f4350524f4f46 (or 'DOCPROOF' in ascii).{%endtrans%}</li>
    <li>{%trans%}Some online services like <a href="http://coinsecrets.org/">
    Coin Secrets</a> or <a href="https://blockchain.info/strange-transactions">
    blockchain.info's list</a> can help you locate OP_RETURN
     transactions more easily.{%endtrans%}</li>
		<li>{%trans%}The existence of that transaction in the blockchain
			proves that the document existed at the time the transaction
      got included into a block.{%endtrans%}</li>
